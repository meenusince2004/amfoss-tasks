# Hello World!
Since I'm new to coding, I olny have a basic understanding of python as of now. I managed to complete this project in Python, but I had to rely on the internet for assistance with the other 2. Additionally, I believe that I need to improve my coding skills because I'm not yet proficient at coding quickly.
