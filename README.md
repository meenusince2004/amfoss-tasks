# SELF-INTRO 
Hello everyone!
My name is Meenakshi, and I'm currently a first-year CSE student. I'm someone who knows a bit about many things and is interested in a variety of subjects. As a result, my hobbies tend to change frequently. In the technical field, I was initially interested in cybersecurity, but now I want to explore different areas before deciding on my career path.
# INTROSPECTION
# WHY YOU MUST CHOOSE ME?
Despite my lack of technical background I believe I possess a natural knack for computers. By selecting me, amfoss gains an enthusiastic member with a strong determination to excel and contribute effectively to the team's objectives.
# HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
If chosen to be a part of the amfoss club, I would contribute in several meaningful ways. Despite my initial lack of technical background, I am enthusiastic about learning and determined to rapidly acquire necessary skills. I would put in the effort to catch up on technical concepts and contribute to the club's projects and I'm also dedicated to contributing time, energy and ideas to the club's initiative. As I develop my technical skills, I anticipate personal growth that can positively impact both the club and my own future endeavors.
