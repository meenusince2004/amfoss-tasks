So I did the coding using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then, I created this cool little popup thingy you see with HTML and styled it using CSS. I also created a json file that helps chrome in knowing the extension . Chatgpt helped me with this whole task.
Oh and I didn't publish it since I need to pay for it.
