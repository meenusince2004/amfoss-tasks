# Hypertext Mockup Language
Since I was a beginner, just by looking at the two website designs, I felt overwhelmed and doubted my ability to clone a website, as I had never done it before. However, this experience turned out to be amazing, and I learned a lot from it. It took me a considerable amount of time, and at first, I had managed to create the HTML and add the background image. But then, I made the decision to delete everything and start from scratch. Also I only noticed the assets directory after completing the task, so I had to download and edit the social media logos separately. For the logo on the top left of the nav bar, I took a screenshot and made it into a sticker. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the entire task.
